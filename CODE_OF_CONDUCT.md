# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Commit Best Practices

In order to maintain clarity and consistency in the development process, we ask that contributors adhere to the following best practices when making commits:

1. **Write clear and concise commit messages**:
   - The commit message should be a short, descriptive statement that explains why the change was made, not just what was changed.
   - Example of a good commit message: `Fix bug in user authentication flow`
   - Avoid vague messages like `Fixed stuff` or `Update code`.

2. **Use the imperative mood**:
   - Write your commit messages in the imperative form (like giving a command), because it's consistent with generated Git messages (e.g., "Merge branch").
   - Example: `Add login functionality` or `Update user profile page`.

3. **Commit frequently but in logical chunks**:
   - Make commits that contain meaningful changes related to one specific feature or bug fix.
   - Avoid committing unrelated changes in the same commit.

4. **Include references to issues or pull requests**:
   - If the commit addresses a bug or a feature request from an issue tracker, include the issue number in the commit message.
   - Example: `Fix login issue #34` or `Resolve bug reported in #45`.

## Branching Strategy

When working on a new feature or bug fix, please follow this branching strategy:

1. **Create a new branch** for each task:
   - Branches should be named according to the feature or issue being worked on.
   - Example: `feature/login-functionality` or `bugfix/missing-field-validation`.

2. **Rebase frequently**:
   - If you're working on a long-running branch, rebase your changes with the `main` branch regularly to avoid conflicts later.

3. **Merge branches with clear intent**:
   - Once a feature is complete, and after ensuring the code passes all tests, merge it into the `main` branch with a pull request (PR).
   - Provide a detailed description in the PR about the changes made and how they impact the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [jxuand3@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
